					We sign up for some random websites on the
					internet with sensitive personal details, such as 
					email address, date of birth, and legal name! But, what
					happens after such details are given to the online service matters.
					Sometimes, we continue to use those online services for years and years
					with no issues. Most of the times, we simply abandon using the online service
					for good and leave our personal information with them. As time passes on,
					the online service might get hacked and all of your personal data gets to be on
					the hacker's database! What happens to that information is unknown, it might be sold
					to spammers or governments, who knows? Thus, there is a old saying that..

				</p>
				<a class="BrowserDownloadLink" title="Download Firefox" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">

				<p class="li-description">
					Using a privacy respecting browser such as 
					<a title="Download Firefox" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>®️
					or 
					<a title="Download Brave" href="https://brave.com/download/">Brave</a>®️
					(not so preferred, I recommend it because of PWA support)
					will give you privacy benefits right out of the box, such as the built-in
					adblocking with Brave®️ and advanced tracker blocking with Firefox®️.

					<a name="#li3" href="#li3">Use an Adblocker</a>

				</a>
				<p class="li-description">
					I don't know how people can browse the web without one.
					If you visit one of those news websites, you'll be bombarded with ads
					all over the screen. In addition, some ads even redirect to malicious websites
					that want you to "Update Chrome®️/Firefox®️/Flash®️".
					Anyway, one of the best adblocker in town is 
					<a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>™
					and It's not recommended to use any other AdBlocker such as 
					<a href="https://adblockplus.org/">Adblock Plus</a>®️.

		<p class="Article-Conclusion">
			In short, If you implement all the strategies described
			above, you will have 70-90% more online privacy than before!
			As a note, it's better to view privacy as a slow and gradual process that
			involves spending some 2-4 hours of time per year rather than a one-time process.
